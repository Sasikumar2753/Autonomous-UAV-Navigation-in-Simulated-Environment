# Autonomous-UAV-Navigation-in-Simulated-Environment
Led the development and implementation of an AI-based autonomous drone navigation system using Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL).
Designed and integrated path planning, real-time obstacle detection, and adaptive learning using AirSim (simulation environment), Unreal Engine, and Kalman Filters for motion prediction.
Developed the full coding framework, including environment perception, decision-making algorithms, and reinforcement learning models, ensuring seamless drone navigation in dynamic environments.
Published a journal paper on this project and presented it at a technical conference, showcasing its innovative approach to real-time autonomous navigation and AI-driven obstacle avoidance.
